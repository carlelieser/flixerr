# Flixerr
The best free movie torrent streaming app.

### Installation
To install Flixerr, head into the build folder and download the package appropriate for your system. Alternatively, you can click the download button on our website.

### Features
Flixerr makes it easy to stream movies straight from your desktop. Just find the movie you want to watch, and click play.

#### Blazing fast torrent streaming
Not only do we find the best quality torrent to stream, but we also use the best available torrent streaming client for Nodejs - WebTorrent. 

#### Beautiful User Interface
Flixerr boasts a clean, minimalistic design with smooth and consistent animations throughout.

#### Cloud syncing using Google Firebase
Flixerr persists your streaming data across multiple devices on the same account. This includes favorites, recently watched, streaming quality preference, and where you left off.

#### No bullshit
We don't use ads or try to scam you. However, due to the legality of movie torrents, please use Flixerr at your own discretion.

### How it works
First, Flixerr searches for torrents of that movie on multiple torrent sites. It then sorts through the results to find the best quality torrents and then plays one that matches your resolution preference and meets our specific threshold. 

The process is as follows:
1. Movie name is used to find torrents.
2. Torrents are sorted.
3. Torrent is streamed.
4. Torrent is saved in case the user tries to watch the same movie more than once.
